## My process

I started by defining each element of the page with its respective HTML tag, always trying to use semantic tags, after defining them I started thinking about how to structure the site and then I chose to use FlexBox to help me with this task, I could have used Grid, but, in my opinion, in this task it would not be so necessary and I believe it would take longer to increase Grid instead of Flex.
I defined a parent container, and assigned two child containers to it and from that I just started styling the elements in CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Background-Image

### What I learned

In this challenge I had a lot of difficulty understanding the importance of certain elements having a defined width and height, I spent a long time trying to understand why things weren't flowing correctly until I realized it was due to the lack of a defined width, the use of automatic measurements that adjusting according to the elements is great, but I learned that there are certain situations in which they can or cannot be used and you need to realize this for a good page construction.

### Continued development

I'm still a beginner, but I already realize that I need to continue developing my perception as a programmer to find solutions to any problems that I may encounter when programming, in addition to also being able to better visualize which path I will follow when creating pages for the web, what is the best way to build a given website.
